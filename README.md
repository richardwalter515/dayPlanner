## dayPlanner
This Workday Scheduler is designed to dynamically update throughout the day.
When an hour of the day is grey, it is in the past.  When it is red, it is currently happening, and when it is green it is in the future.
When you enter text into an hour of the day and click "save," the text will remain there even if you navigate away from the Scheduler.

You can find the application here: https://richardwalter515.github.io/dayPlanner/
